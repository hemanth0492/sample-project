Advantage of JSON -
1. JSON is Faster - JSON syntax is very easy to use. We have to use only as an syntax which provide us a easy parsing of the data and faster execution of the data. Since its syntax is very small and light weighted that's the reason that it executes the response in faster way.

2. Server Parsing - On the server side parsing is the important part that developers want if the parsing will be fast on the server side then only user can get the fast response of their response so in this case JSON server side parsing is strong point that indicates us to use the JSON on server side.

3. Schema Support - It has wide range of supported browser compatibility with the operating systems so the applications made with the coding of JSON doesn't require much effort to make it all browser compatible. During development developer thinks for the different different browsers but JSON provides that functionality.

4. Tool for sharing data - JSON is the best tool for the sharing data of any size even audio, video etc. This is because JSON stores the data in the arrays so data transfer makes easier. For this reason, JSON is a superior file format for web APIs and for web development
